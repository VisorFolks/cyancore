 * zero_reg - Needs to be called after reset of CPU
 *
 * @brief This function is reponsible to reset all the register to 0 to
 * remove junk value that gets stored on reset due to undefined
 * state of registers.
 * As per the abi spec of AVR5-8, r1 is always supposed to be 0.
 * Hence, r1 is reset to 0 and other are moved with r1.
